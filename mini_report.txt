A small report after doind the logistic regression modelling:



A logistic regression model was fitted to predict the probability of diabetes based on the
variables BMI and Age. When predicting that a person is more likely to have diabetes than not
have diabetes, the true positive rate was a disappointing 0.0191 (1.9%) (using the test
data set). To identify more people that might have diabetes, the definition of “high risk”
was changed to the probability of diabetes being 0.19 or more. This increased the
sensitivity to 49%.
